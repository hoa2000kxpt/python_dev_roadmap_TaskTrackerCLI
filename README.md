# Task Tracker CLI App

Task Tracker CLI is a simple command-line interface application to help you track and manage your tasks. This tool allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasks, as well as mark them as in-progress or done. Tasks are stored in a JSON file, making it easy to persist and manage your to-do list.

## Features 🔥

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks with a description.
- **Update Tasks**: Modify the description of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark as In Progress**: Mark tasks that you are currently working on.
- **Mark as Done**: Mark tasks as completed.
- **List Tasks**: View all tasks or filter by status (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`).
